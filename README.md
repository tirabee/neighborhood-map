# Neighborhood Map
This is the final project in the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. It's a small app which displays some nearby locations based of a certain type (in this case, pizza restaurants).

# Usage
To use this app, download or clone the repository, and run `npm install` within the directory. Then, run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000`.
You can also use `npm build` to get the app into production mode, complete with service worker.
